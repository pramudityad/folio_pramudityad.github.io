Was this such a worthy and sensible price comparing in my ‘selfishly’ deal on letting my mother struggle in her upcoming <em>loneliness</em> and juggling work-matter which now in the alarming phase on unexpected market and world event that could be happend anytime</p> </blockquote> <p>There’s always though in my head that I should do more in this family, taking care, finish un-resolve problem etc. Aware that problem may came in many ways, its just how we handle them.</p> <p>Time is relative short if we know how to use them properly, thats what bothers me. What if this not the right time? what if something happened in between? But I let it shinking at the moment, for those who seek peacefull should not wory about the future. At least I keep telling my self that.</p> <p>However, much above it, my mind always rebels too far beyond. I fully conscious that what I’ve done is still nothing, I am far from being skilled, so that I should learn very much from the world for the upcoming and un-ended hard work should be done.</p> <p>For answering my unforgivable blues, that this came not for a wrong reason for me. There’re always not enough time to be fully ready. The universe might untoldly reaffirm that living a dream always possible, no matter how wild your dreams are. Let me try to do my best.</p> <p>If above paragraph is <em>confession</em>. The last one will be my ‘prayer’ and what I ask is <strong>forgiveness</strong>.</p> </body></html>
