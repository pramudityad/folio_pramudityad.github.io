After the call ended turned out it was a bad news, without any good news.</p> <p>This past month I have a though, sometimes followed by a strage dream in night, perhaps I could say it was a nightmare. Though It do not disturb my daily activity <del>a lot</del>, but the vision easily came back when im not doing anything.</p> <p>..</p> <p>Then I realize that I need to seek for professional help.</p> <blockquote> <p>Solving the problem is one thing, admit you have a problem is another thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Used chat feature in one of telemedicine app. With 30k IDR I booked 40mins session with psyhiciater. Felt strange at first to tell the stories to stranger at the moment (but we are stranger for everyone right). From quora iâ€™ve read tips to write your story first in blank text page so when the session ready you could easily copy and paste to the chat box.</p> <p>40 minutes passed by, the psyhiciater provides notes based on the conversation. The irony is I expected all the notes she gave, and all of them is correct. She really know to press where its hurts.</p> <p>Which leads to, the rest is up to me.</p> </body></html>
