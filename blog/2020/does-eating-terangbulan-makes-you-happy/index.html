We dont talk only about affection, because i think all love maybe equals but love from parent to children is eternal. The point is as long someone treated with love or find love they deserve thus they will give another people love too</p> <p>p.s Terangbulan tasted better than Martabak. and i dont know why</p> </body></html>
